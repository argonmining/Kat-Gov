# Kat Gov Application Overview

The **Kat Gov** project is an ambitious governance web application designed to facilitate transparent, decentralized decision-making within a blockchain-based community. This platform will allow members to submit proposals, participate in elections, cast votes, and access historical records of governance actions. The entire system operates without requiring users to connect their personal wallets, instead leveraging a unique, secure setup for managing contributions and votes directly on the blockchain.

Kat Gov is built on Bun, TypeScript, Express, and PostgreSQL. It integrates closely with the Kaspa blockchain to provide real-time data for voting processes and proposal submissions, while storing metadata in PostgreSQL for fast, reliable access to historical records.

## Project Objectives

The main goal of Kat Gov is to establish a decentralized, transparent governance system that gives users a direct voice in decisions. The platform is built to embody the values of blockchain—decentralization, transparency, and community empowerment. By allowing users to submit, vote on, and track proposals, Kat Gov provides a structured system for community-driven governance.

## Core Features

1. **Proposal Submission and Voting**:
   - Users can submit proposals across various categories, such as funding, development, or governance.
   - Each proposal has a lifecycle, with stages like nomination, voting, and archival.
   - Voting is conducted by sending tokens to designated addresses (YES/NO), allowing for decentralized participation without wallet connections.
   - A snapshot feature takes account balances at the start of each voting cycle to prevent manipulation.

2. **Elections for Governance Positions**:
   - Users can nominate candidates for specific governance roles, with open positions visible on the application.
   - Voting for candidates is conducted similarly to proposals, with tokens sent to candidate-specific addresses.
   - Results are tallied at the end of the election period and stored for historical reference.
   - Winning candidates are recorded for each position, adding transparency to leadership selection.

3. **Nomination System**:
   - Proposals and candidates require nominations to ensure community support before advancing to voting.
   - Each proposal or candidate requires a submission fee and additional nominations from unique wallets.
   - Nominations are tracked and displayed to ensure transparency and community engagement.

4. **Historical Data Access**:
   - The platform stores comprehensive historical data, allowing users to view past proposals, election results, and vote tallies.
   - Users can filter and search through past actions, making the governance process both transparent and accessible.

5. **Automated Token Burning**:
   - At the end of each proposal and election cycle, accumulated tokens are sent to a burn address.
   - This process reduces token supply, adding a deflationary element to the governance process.

6. **Dynamic Address Generation**:
   - The platform dynamically generates addresses for voting, nomination, and election participation.
   - This ensures each cycle is fresh and secure, with new addresses tied to specific events.

## Backend Architecture and Technologies

The backend is structured for modularity and scalability, with distinct layers and components for configuration, database management, business logic, API routes, and external integrations. Here’s an overview of the main components:

- **Configuration Layer**: Manages connection settings for the database and APIs (Kaspa and Kasplex) and loads environment variables securely.
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**: Stores all governance data, including proposals, votes, elections, and historical records. Data is organized into tables with relationships that allow for easy querying and retrieval.
- **Controllers**: Implements business logic for handling incoming requests, such as creating a proposal or recording a vote.
- **Routes**: Maps HTTP routes to controllers, allowing clients to interact with the backend through RESTful endpoints.
- **Services**: Integrates with external systems, like the Kaspa blockchain and Kasplex API, to retrieve blockchain data, create snapshots, and perform token burns.
- **Middleware**: Performs data validation and could potentially handle authorization if needed.

### Key Services and External Integrations

1. **Kaspa and Kasplex API Integration**:
   - The Kaspa and Kasplex APIs provide essential blockchain data, such as balance checks and transaction monitoring.
   - The application will use the Kasplex API for static data retrieval (e.g., checking balances at specific addresses) and the Kaspa WASM framework for more complex operations like creating snapshots.

2. **Snapshot Management**:
   - Snapshots are taken at the start of each voting or election cycle, recording the token balances of participants.
   - Snapshots are essential for vote counting, ensuring that only eligible tokens are counted, based on the snapshot at the beginning of the cycle.

3. **Token Burning Service**:
   - At the end of each cycle, accumulated tokens are sent to a designated burn address.
   - This deflationary mechanism reduces token supply over time, benefiting the remaining token holders.

4. **Dynamic Address Generation**:
   - Voting and nomination addresses are dynamically generated for each proposal and election cycle.
   - This setup prevents address reuse, enhancing the security and transparency of the process.

## Application Workflow

1. **Proposal Submission**:
   - A user submits a proposal through the platform, selecting the proposal category and paying a nominal token submission fee.
   - Once submitted, the proposal enters the nomination phase, requiring additional community support before moving to a vote.

2. **Nomination and Voting**:
   - Community members nominate proposals by sending tokens to specific addresses.
   - When a proposal gains enough support, it moves to the voting phase, where users cast votes (YES or NO) by sending tokens to designated addresses.
   - Votes are recorded and displayed in real time.

3. **Elections**:
   - For governance positions, users can nominate candidates and participate in elections by voting for their preferred candidate.
   - Election results are calculated and stored in the database, providing a permanent record of governance decisions.

4. **Token Burn**:
   - After each voting or election cycle, accumulated tokens are automatically sent to a burn address.
   - This process is transparent, with transaction records available for auditing.

## Goals and Vision

Kat Gov aims to empower its community with a fair, decentralized governance model that avoids reliance on centralized wallet connections or custodial control. By leveraging the Kaspa blockchain, Kat Gov ensures transparency, accountability, and security in all governance processes. The project will not only serve its initial community but will also be available as an open-source solution for other blockchain communities looking to implement similar decentralized governance systems.

The Kat Gov backend is now structured to accommodate each of these goals, and with the setup guide provided, a developer or AI instance should be able to continue building this application to completion.

## Detailed Endpoint Explanations

### Proposal Endpoints (`proposalRoutes.ts`)
- `POST /proposals`: Creates a new proposal.
- `GET /proposals`: Retrieves a list of proposals, with optional filters.
- `GET /proposals/:id`: Retrieves details for a specific proposal.
- `PATCH /proposals/:id/status`: Updates the status of a proposal.
- `POST /proposals/:id/vote`: Submits a vote for a proposal.
- `POST /proposals/:id/nominate`: Nominate a proposal.

### Election Endpoints (`electionRoutes.ts`)
- `POST /elections`: Creates a new election.
- `GET /elections`: Retrieves a list of elections.
- `GET /elections/:id`: Retrieves details for a specific election.
- `PATCH /elections/:id/status`: Updates the status of an election.
- `POST /elections/:id/vote`: Submits a vote for a candidate in an election.
- `POST /elections/:id/nominate`: Nominate a candidate for an election.

### Candidate Endpoints (`candidateRoutes.ts`)
- `POST /candidates`: Add a candidate.
- `GET /candidates`: Retrieve a list of candidates.
- `GET /candidates/:id`: Retrieve candidate details.

### Snapshot Endpoints
- `POST /snapshots`: Trigger a snapshot for an active election/proposal period.

### Historical Data Endpoints
- `GET /history/proposals`: Retrieve historical proposal data.
- `GET /history/elections`: Retrieve historical election data.

Each endpoint should:
1. Validate data using `validationMiddleware`.
2. Call the appropriate controller function for the business logic.
3. Return structured JSON responses with error handling.

## Testing and Validation

Testing is essential for maintaining the stability of the backend.

### Suggested Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions in models, controllers, and services for correct logic.
- **Integration Tests**: Test API routes and their interactions with controllers and models.
- **Service Tests**: Ensure that services return expected results from external APIs (e.g., Kaspa and Kasplex APIs).

Each test should be designed to confirm that data is processed correctly and error handling functions as expected.
